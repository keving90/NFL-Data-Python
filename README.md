# NFL-Data-Python
This repository contains a Python program capable of scraping data from [Pro Football Reference](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/). The `rb_scraper` will download data from Pro Football Reference's "Rushing and Receiving" data table for each of the last 5 years and save the data in one large data frame. Then, the program filters the data out so the only remaining players are runningbacks with 50 or more carries in each of the last 5 seasons.

Currently, this is the only program in the repository, but I hope to add different programs that create different dataframes in the future.
